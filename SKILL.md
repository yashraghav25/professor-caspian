# caspian-sdk: give an AI agent real communication channels

You are integrating messaging into an AI agent using caspian-sdk. It gives an
agent a real presence on many channels behind ONE `on_message` handler and one
`message.reply()` - the same code answers on every channel. The gateway is
hosted at https://api.trycaspianai.com.

## How to drive this (read first)

The developer may just say "add caspian-sdk" without naming channels. Do this:

1. Do steps 1-3 below (key, install, the shared handler) - always needed.
2. Discover which channels are actually connectable RIGHT NOW:
   `curl -s https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/channels -H "Authorization: Bearer $CASPIAN_API_KEY"`
   That returns the live channels (currently: email, discord, slack, x,
   telegram, phone/SMS, bluesky). Phone/SMS is BRING-YOUR-OWN (the developer's
   own Twilio/Telnyx number - see that section). Bluesky is BRING-YOUR-OWN too
   (the developer's own Bluesky handle + an app password - see that section).
   Only offer those. Other channels (WhatsApp, Voice, RCS, Instagram, Facebook,
   iMessage) exist in the SDK but are NOT live on this gateway yet - do NOT try
   to connect them (they 400). If a developer asks for one of those, tell them
   it's "coming soon / being integrated" - don't attempt it and don't
   apologize at length; just say it's on the way. A channel may occasionally
   appear MORE THAN ONCE - each row is a different `provider` for that channel;
   when that happens, ask which provider they want and pass it as `provider=`
   to `connect_*()`.
3. ASK the developer which of the live channels they want (email needs nothing;
   others need a token or an OAuth click - see the per-channel sections). Don't
   assume; list the live options and let them choose. Email is a safe default
   if they don't care.
4. Connect each chosen channel (sections below), then verify with a test.

Every channel uses the SAME handler from step 3 - adding one is just another
`client.connect_*()` call, never new handler code.

## 1. Get an API key

If `CASPIAN_API_KEY` is already in the project's `.env`, SKIP this step.

**Free channels need NO signup.** Email, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Instagram,
Facebook, Bluesky, and the developer's own Twilio/Telnyx number cost nothing — just
mint an instant key and start building:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/projects/sandbox \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"my-agent"}'
```

Returns `{"project_id":"...","api_key":"comm_sandbox_..."}`. Write it to `.env`:

```
CASPIAN_API_KEY=<api_key>
CASPIAN_BASE_URL=https://api.trycaspianai.com
```

**Free channels need no sign-in. Paid channels need a one-time sign-in, then credit.**
Free channels (email, Telegram, Discord, Slack) work instantly with just the API
key. Channels on Caspian's paid network (X, WhatsApp, iMessage) are gated on two
things, both surfaced as machine-actionable JSON:

**a) One-time developer sign-in (401 `account_required`).** The first paid action
returns **401** with `login_options`. Paid spend must be tied to a real account.
Get the developer signed in once (they never sign in again after this):

1. `POST https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/auth/device/start` with `{"api_key": "<your key>"}` (so THIS
   project binds to their account - nothing you built is lost).
2. SHOW the developer `verification_uri_complete` and WAIT for them to sign in.
3. Poll `POST https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/auth/device/token` with `{"device_code": ...}` until
   `status` is `approved`, then retry the call.

**b) Prepaid credit (402 `insufficient_credit`).** Once signed in, a paid action
returns **402** with `payment_options` if the balance is too low:

1. Check the balance any time: `GET https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/billing` (Bearer auth).
2. The developer adds credit in the dashboard. SHOW them this link and WAIT:

> Add credit to keep {channel} running: https://dashboard.trycaspianai.com

3. Credit lands seconds after payment - poll `GET https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/billing` until
   `balance_cents` rises (or watch for the `billing.credited` event), then retry
   the call that 402'd.

**Autopay + spend limits (set them, they protect the developer):** after one
checkout the card is saved automatically. The agent can then enable
replenishment and caps over the API - a monthly cap is REQUIRED for autopay:

```bash
curl -s -X PUT https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/billing/autopay -H "Authorization: Bearer $CASPIAN_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"threshold_cents":500,"topup_cents":2000,"monthly_cap_cents":10000}'
```

`PUT https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/billing/limits` sets `monthly_cap_cents` / per-channel
`channel_caps`. Watch for `billing.low_balance` and `billing.limit_reached`
events on the normal event stream and tell the developer when they fire.

## 2. Install the SDK

```bash
uv add caspian-sdk
# or: pip install caspian-sdk
```

## 3. Integrate - one handler for every channel

The SDK reads CASPIAN_API_KEY and CASPIAN_BASE_URL from the environment or ./.env
automatically. Write the handler ONCE; it fires for whatever channels you
connect below.

```python
from caspian_sdk import CommClient

client = CommClient()

# Connect the channels the developer chose (see the per-channel sections).
# Email needs nothing and is the safe default:
email = client.connect_email(username="scout")   # ASK the developer for the name
print("Agent email:", email["address"])          # e.g. scout@agents.trycaspianai.com
# client.connect_telegram(bot_token=...)   # if they want Telegram
# client.connect_discord(bot_token=...)    # if they want Discord

@client.on_message
def handle(message):
    # Same for every channel: message.text, message.sender, message.conversation_id
    # (conversation_id is stable per thread - key your agent's memory on it)
    answer = your_agent_logic(message.text)
    message.reply(answer)   # replies on whichever channel the message arrived from

client.listen()
```

Wire `your_agent_logic` to whatever the developer's agent framework is
(OpenAI Agents SDK, LangGraph, plain LLM call). The reply must be plain text.

### Make the agent platform-aware (optional, recommended)

Each channel behaves differently - Slack threads, WhatsApp's 24h window, SMS
length limits, iMessage has no markdown, X caps public replies at 280. Caspian
returns concise etiquette for the channels the developer connected; inject it into
the agent's system prompt so replies fit each platform:

```python
guide = client.behavior_prompt()   # combined guide for connected channels
system_prompt = system_prompt + "\n\n" + guide
```

On any SDK version you can fetch it directly instead:
`curl -s https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/behavior-prompt -H "Authorization: Bearer $CASPIAN_API_KEY"`
(or one channel: `https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/channels/slack/guide`). It's a suggestion - the
developer can use it as-is, tweak it, or write their own. Offer it; don't force it.

STOP before connecting email - you MUST ask the developer what mailbox NAME they
want (the part before the @) and WAIT for their answer. Do NOT call a bare
`connect_email()` - that auto-generates an ugly random name like
scout-a3f9@... and is almost never what they want. Once they tell you the name:
`client.connect_email(username="<their choice>")` -> <choice>@agents.trycaspianai.com.
If that name is taken the API replies 409 with a `suggestions` list of readable
alternatives - show those and let them pick one. If they'd rather use their OWN
domain, follow the custom-domain section and pass `domain=` too (e.g.
username="kernel", domain="agents.acme.com" -> kernel@agents.acme.com).

## 4. Verify it works

With the integration running in one terminal, deliver a test email:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/test-emails -H "Authorization: Bearer $CASPIAN_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text":"hello, are you alive?"}'
```

Within ~10 seconds the running integration must print the inbound message and
send a reply. Confirm by checking events:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/events?type=message.sent" -H "Authorization: Bearer $CASPIAN_API_KEY"
```

If a `message.sent` event appears, the integration is complete. Tell the
developer their agent's email address; real emails to it from any mail client
now reach the handler.

If the developer sends a REAL email and says no reply arrived, FIRST tell them to
check their SPAM/Junk folder. A `message.sent` event (above) means the reply WAS
sent - a brand-new sending domain has no reputation yet, so Gmail/Outlook often
file the first replies as spam. Ask them to open it and click "Not spam"; that
trains the inbox and later replies land normally. This is deliverability warmup,
not a bug. Only if there's no `message.sent` event is something actually wrong.

## Custom email domain (optional)

By default addresses live on the platform domain. If the developer wants their
own brand (e.g. support-x@agents.acme.com), ask them:

> Do you want agent email addresses on your own domain? If yes, tell me a
> dedicated subdomain of a domain you control (e.g. agents.yourcompany.com).
> Do not use your root domain - its existing mail would be affected.

Then:

1. Register it: `client.add_domain("agents.acme.com")` (REST: POST https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/domains
   with `{"domain": "agents.acme.com"}`).
2. Show the developer the returned `dns_records` and tell them to add each at
   their DNS provider. A zone file for bulk import is at
   `https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/domains/{id}/zone-file`.
3. Poll `GET https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/domains/{id}` until `status` is `active` (DNS can take
   minutes). Do not guess; wait for the developer to confirm the records are in.
4. Connect on the domain: `client.connect_email(domain="agents.acme.com")` -
   the address is now on their domain, sending is DKIM-signed as their domain.
   To pick the exact address, add `username="kernel"` ->
   kernel@agents.acme.com (custom domains only; 409 if taken).

## Adding Slack (ask which kind of app)

Slack comes THREE ways - STOP and ask the developer:

> Slack connects as an app installed to a workspace. Three options:
>   a) Quick (one click) - add our shared app; nothing to create. Custom name +
>      icon, so it still looks like your brand.
>   b) Branded - your OWN Slack app in YOUR workspace (~5 min); you control the
>      app name and the @mention.
>   c) Distribute - your OWN Slack app that you PUBLISH and install into your
>      CUSTOMERS' workspaces (the same way Caspian does its shared app). ~10 min
>      once, then one "Add to Slack" link per customer.
> Which - Quick, Branded, or Distribute?

### a) Quick - shared app (one-click OAuth, no app to create)

Ask the developer what name (and optional icon URL) the agent should post under:

> What should the agent be called in Slack? (e.g. "Acme Support") Optionally an
> icon image URL too.

Then: `result = client.install_slack(display_name="<their name>", icon_url="<url>")`
returns a connection with an `authorize_url` ("Add to Slack"). Give the developer
that URL: "Open this, pick your workspace, and authorize." The shared app installs
into their workspace, the connection flips to `active` on its own (poll
`GET https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/connections/{id}` or watch for `connection.active`), and the agent
posts under their name + icon. Messages in that workspace reach the same
`on_message` handler. If `install_slack()` 400s, the shared app isn't configured on
this gateway - use (b). NEVER default the name to "Caspian"/an infra name - ask.

### b) / c) Your own Slack app (b = your workspace, c = distribute to customers)

Both use an app the developer OWNS; (c) just also turns on public distribution so
they can install it into OTHER workspaces. Walk the developer through creating it -
tell them to do EXACTLY this at api.slack.com/apps -> Create New App -> From scratch:

1. OAuth & Permissions -> Redirect URLs -> add `https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/oauth/slack/callback`, Save.
2. OAuth & Permissions -> Bot Token Scopes -> add: chat:write, chat:write.customize,
   channels:history, im:history, app_mentions:read.
3. Event Subscriptions -> toggle On -> Request URL:
   `https://api.trycaspianai.com/internal/providers/slack/webhooks` (it verifies instantly). Under
   "Subscribe to bot events" add: message.channels, message.im, app_mention, Save.
4. (Option c ONLY) Manage Distribution -> finish the checklist ->
   "Activate Public Distribution". This is what lets the app install into your
   customers' workspaces, not just your own.
5. Basic Information -> App Credentials -> copy Client ID, Client Secret, and
   Signing Secret, and paste all three to me.

Then connect:
- b) your workspace: `client.connect_slack(slack_client_id=..., slack_client_secret=...,
  slack_signing_secret=...)` returns a connection with an `authorize_url`. Open it,
  pick your workspace, Allow -> the connection goes `active`.
- c) per customer: call `connect_slack(...)` with the SAME app creds but a DIFFERENT
  `customer_id` for each customer (ask the developer for a label per customer, e.g.
  their company name). Each call returns its OWN `authorize_url` ("Add to Slack").
  Send that link to that customer; they pick THEIR workspace and Allow. Every
  customer's workspace routes back to the same `on_message` handler, isolated by
  customer_id, and inbound from all of them shares the one events URL - routed
  automatically by app + team.

CLI: `caspian connect slack` prints the authorize link.

## Adding Instagram or Facebook (OAuth channels)

Same OAuth-link pattern (gateway-configured app):

1. `client.connect_instagram(...)` / `connect_facebook(...)` returns a connection
   with an `authorize_url`.
2. Give the developer that URL: "Click this to authorize in your account."
3. They approve; the platform redirects to our callback and the connection flips
   to active. Poll `GET https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/connections/{id}` until `active`.
4. The same `on_message` handler now answers on that channel.

## Adding Discord (ask which kind of bot)

The agent connects to Discord as a bot (two-way: people message it, it replies).
There are two ways to get that bot - STOP and ask the developer:

> Discord connects as a bot. Two options:
>   a) Quick (one click) - add our shared bot to your server; no token to create.
>      You give it a custom name; it uses a shared avatar.
>   b) Branded - create your OWN bot (~5 min) so it has your own name AND avatar.
> Which - Quick (shared) or Branded (your own)?

### a) Quick - shared bot (one-click OAuth, no token)

First ASK the developer what name the bot should show in their server:

> What should the bot be called in your server? (e.g. "Acme Support")

Then pass it as `display_name`:
`result = client.install_discord(display_name="<their chosen name>")` returns a
connection with an `authorize_url`. Give the developer that URL: "Open this, pick
your server, and authorize." Discord adds the shared bot, renames it to their
chosen name in that server, and the connection flips to `active` on its own (poll
`GET /v1/connections/{id}` or watch for `connection.active`). Messages in that
server then reach the same `on_message` handler; `message.reply()` answers. If
`install_discord()` 400s, the shared bot isn't configured on this gateway - use
(b). A 409 on the callback means that server is already linked to an agent. (The
custom name is a per-server nickname; avatar stays shared - use (b) for a custom
avatar too.) NEVER default the name to "Caspian" or an infra name - ask.

### b) Branded - bring your own bot

> Create a bot at discord.com/developers -> New Application -> Bot -> Reset
> Token -> copy it. Enable the "Message Content Intent" under Bot settings.
> Then paste me the token.

Then `client.connect_discord(bot_token="<token>")`. Same `on_message` handler
answers; `message.reply()` replies in Discord. A 409 means that bot is already
connected elsewhere - use a different one.

Either way, replies use the developer's agent - only the bot's name/avatar differs
(shared name vs their own bot). Never brand the bot as Caspian/the gateway.

## Adding Telegram (optional second channel)

Telegram needs one thing only a human can create: a bot token. STOP and ask
the developer for it with exactly these instructions:

> Open Telegram and message @BotFather. Send /newbot, choose a name and a
> username, and paste me the token it gives you (looks like 7123456789:AAE...).

Do not proceed without the token and never invent one. Once the developer
provides it:

```python
telegram = client.connect_telegram(bot_token="<token from developer>")
print("Telegram bot:", telegram["address"])   # @their_bot
```

Or via CLI: `caspian connect telegram --bot-token <token>`.

The same @client.on_message handler receives Telegram messages; message.reply()
answers in the chat. No other setup - the gateway registers the webhook.

To verify: tell the developer to open Telegram, search for the bot's @username,
and send it any message. The running integration must print it and reply within
a few seconds.

Error handling: a 409 from connect means that bot token is already connected
elsewhere - ask the developer for a different bot. A 422 naming `bot_token`
means it was missing or malformed.

## Adding WhatsApp (ask which provider first)

WhatsApp is served by TWO providers on this gateway, so it appears twice in
/v1/channels. They behave differently, so STOP and ask the developer which one
with exactly this choice:

> WhatsApp has two options here:
>   1. Twilio - fastest to test. A shared sandbox number works in minutes (great
>      for a demo); a dedicated production number needs a paid Twilio account +
>      WhatsApp sender approval.
>   2. Meta (direct) - connect your OWN branded WhatsApp Business number through
>      a one-time Meta popup (Embedded Signup). Best for production and brand.
> Which do you want - Twilio (quick test) or Meta (branded)?

Pass their choice as `provider=` on connect. Same `on_message` handler either way.

### Option 1 - Twilio (test now)

```python
wa = client.connect_whatsapp(provider="twilio-whatsapp")
print("WhatsApp on:", wa["address"])   # the Twilio number (sandbox by default)
```

For inbound to reach the agent, the developer must do two one-time things in the
Twilio Console (Messaging -> Try it out -> Send a WhatsApp message):

1. Set "When a message comes in" to
   `https://api.trycaspianai.com/internal/providers/twilio-whatsapp/webhooks` (HTTP POST), and Save.
2. From their own WhatsApp, send the shown `join <two-words>` to the sandbox
   number (+1 415 523 8886) to opt in.

Then any message they send that number reaches the same handler and gets a reply.

### Option 2 - Meta (branded, Embedded Signup)

A one-time Meta popup connects the developer's (or their customer's) own WhatsApp
Business number - no tokens to copy or paste:

```python
session = client.start_whatsapp_onboarding()
print("Open this to connect WhatsApp:", session["launcher_url"])
```

Give the developer that `launcher_url`. They click through the Meta popup once
and their number provisions onto the agent. Poll `GET https://api.trycaspianai.com/v1/connections/{id}`
until status is `active` (or watch for the `connection.active` event). If
`start_whatsapp_onboarding()` returns 400, Embedded Signup isn't configured on
this gateway yet - fall back to Option 1 (Twilio).

Either way, WhatsApp business rules apply: the agent can reply freely for 24h
after a user messages it; starting a conversation cold needs an approved
template. The developer's `on_message` code doesn't change - the gateway handles
the difference.

## Adding SMS / phone (bring your own number - ask which provider)

The agent gets a real phone line for two-way SMS. It's BRING-YOUR-OWN: the
developer uses their OWN Twilio or Telnyx account + a number they own there, so
their account handles billing and A2P/10DLC registration - Caspian just relays.
STOP and ask which provider:

> SMS runs through your own CPaaS account. Which do you use - Twilio or Telnyx?
> You'll need your account credentials and a phone number you own there.

### Twilio
Ask for: Account SID + Auth Token (console.twilio.com) and your Twilio number (E.164).

```python
sms = client.connect_phone(provider="twilio",
    account_sid="AC...", auth_token="...", from_number="+1...")
```

Then tell the developer to set their Twilio number's inbound "A message comes in"
webhook (Messaging config) to:
`https://api.trycaspianai.com/internal/providers/twilio/webhooks/<your +E.164 number>`

### Telnyx
Ask for: API Key (portal.telnyx.com) and your Telnyx number (E.164).

```python
sms = client.connect_phone(provider="telnyx", api_key="KEY...", from_number="+1...")
```

Then set that number's inbound webhook to:
`https://api.trycaspianai.com/internal/providers/telnyx/webhooks/<your +E.164 number>`

The same `on_message` handler answers SMS; `message.reply()` texts back; it can
also `initiate` (cold-start) a text. A 409 means that number is already connected.
Note: US outbound SMS needs A2P 10DLC (or a verified toll-free) on THEIR Twilio/
Telnyx account - that's on the developer's CPaaS account, not this gateway.

## Adding iMessage (no setup - like email)

iMessage needs NOTHING from the developer - the gateway owns the number over
Caspian's managed iMessage line (Apple has no public API). Just connect:

```python
imessage = client.connect_imessage()
print("iMessage number:", imessage["address"])
```

The same `on_message` handler answers over iMessage. It also supports
cold-initiate (message a number that never messaged first), unlike WhatsApp.

To verify: text the printed number from an iPhone - the running integration
prints the inbound message and replies within a few seconds.

Note: this gateway shares one iMessage number, so it's one connection at a time
(fine for a demo; per-agent numbers are a follow-up). A 409 / "already connected"
on connect means another agent currently holds it.

## Adding Google Meet (voice agent - Beta, no setup)

Put your agent INTO a Google Meet call as a voice participant: it listens and
talks in real time. Needs NOTHING from the developer - no credentials, no setup.

```python
gmeet = client._connect("gmeet")   # hosted beta channel
```

Send the agent into a meeting. A "message" on this channel IS a meeting: the
recipient is the Meet URL, and the text is the persona/instructions for the call:

```python
client.initiate(
    gmeet["id"],
    "https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",
    "You are Caspian, a helpful voice assistant. Introduce yourself briefly.",
)
```

Within ~a minute a participant named "Caspian" asks to join - admit it, and it
converses by voice until the meeting ends, then leaves on its own.

Notes (Beta): one agent per call; works on meetings that allow guest/external
participants; voice in + voice out (no chat/screen). Real-time speech, so give it
a clear persona in `text`.

## Adding X / Twitter (reactive DM bot - ask which kind)

The agent runs an X account as a bot: people DM the account, the agent replies.
REACTIVE only - it answers DMs it receives, never cold-DMs (X ToS). The account
should be labelled "Automated" in X settings. Two ways - STOP and ask:

> X connects your account as a DM bot. Two options:
>   a) Quick (one click) - authorize with "Sign in with X"; nothing to paste.
>   b) Branded - paste your own X app's tokens (create one at developer.x.com).

### a) Quick - one-click OAuth (no tokens to paste)

```python
result = client.install_x()
print("Authorize here:", result["authorize_url"])
```

Give the developer the `authorize_url`, or open it. It says "Sign in with X ->
authorize." IMPORTANT - tell the developer clearly:

> Whatever X account you are LOGGED INTO when you click "Authorize" becomes the
> bot - that handle is what your users will DM. If you don't want your personal
> account to be the bot, create a dedicated X account first (e.g. @yourbrandbot),
> log into it, THEN open this link.

Once they approve, that account becomes the bot and goes active. Then just run the
same `on_message` handler + `client.listen()`. If `install_x()` 400s, the shared X
app isn't configured on this gateway - use option (b).

### b) Branded - bring your own account tokens

Ask the developer for their app's Access Token, Access Token Secret, and numeric
user id (from developer.x.com, Keys & Tokens tab; App permissions "Read and write
and Direct message"). The user id is the part before the dash in the access token.

```python
x = client.connect_x(
    access_token="<Access Token>",
    access_secret="<Access Token Secret>",
    user_id="<numeric user id>",
)
```

Either way: the same `on_message` handler answers X DMs and `message.reply()`
replies in the same DM thread. Inbound arrives by polling (a few seconds' latency,
not instant) - no webhook to set up. A 409 means that X account is already
connected to another agent.

To verify: DM the connected account from any other X account - the running
integration prints the inbound DM and replies within ~10 seconds. Note: X DM
reads/sends are pay-per-use, so the account needs a small credit balance.

## Adding Bluesky (bring your own account + app password)

Bluesky is BRING-YOUR-OWN and free: the agent posts as the developer's OWN
Bluesky account. It needs two things only the developer can create - their handle
and an app password (never the account's real login password). STOP and ask:

> Bluesky connects as your own account. I need two things:
>   1. Your handle (e.g. myagent.bsky.social) or the account email.
>   2. An app password: log in at bsky.app -> Settings -> Privacy and security ->
>      App passwords -> Add App Password, then paste it (xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx).
> Use a DEDICATED account if you don't want your personal handle auto-replying.

Do not proceed without both, and never use the account's real password. Once the
developer provides them:

```python
bsky = client.connect_bluesky(
    identifier="<their handle or email>",
    app_password="<their app password>",
)
print("Bluesky account:", bsky["address"])   # the resolved handle
```

Or via CLI: `caspian connect bluesky` (it prompts for the handle + app password).

The same `on_message` handler answers Bluesky; `message.reply()` posts back in the
same thread. Inbound arrives by polling (a few seconds' latency, no webhook to set
up) - the gateway watches the account's mentions. Capabilities: receive, reply,
send (no cold-initiate). A post is capped at 300 characters and renders NO markdown,
so keep replies short and plain-text. A 409 means that account is already connected
to another agent; a 422 naming `identifier`/`app_password` means one was missing.

To verify: from another Bluesky account, mention the connected handle
(@theirhandle.bsky.social) - the running integration prints the inbound post and
replies within a few seconds.

## Notes

- `connect_email()` is idempotent: calling it again (e.g. on agent restart)
  returns the same connection and address instead of provisioning a new inbox.
- `connect_email()` with no arguments uses a default customer/agent scope.
  For multi-tenant products pass explicit `customer_id` and `agent_id`
  (create them via `client.create_customer(name)` / `client.create_agent(name)`).
- `client.listen()` blocks forever. For custom loops poll
  `client.events(after_seq=cursor)`; events are strictly ordered by `seq`.
- Do not reply to the same message twice; `listen()` already dedupes within
  a run. Persist your own cursor if you need replies across restarts.
- A "typing…" indicator is shown automatically while your handler runs, on
  channels that support it (Discord, Telegram). No code needed; for long work
  call `message.typing()` again to keep it alive (it lasts ~5-10s per call).
- For channels WITHOUT a typing indicator (X, SMS, email), pass
  `client.listen(ack="On it, one moment…")` to send an instant acknowledgement
  reply the moment a message arrives, so the human knows the agent is working
